# Flask-Twitter-Sentiment-Analyzer

A small uWSGI application built in python to search and analyze tweets based on the given input search key and tweet count.
We are using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) as the web framework and [tweepy](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/api.html) library to access the twitter api.
