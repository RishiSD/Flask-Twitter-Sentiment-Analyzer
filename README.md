# Flask-Twitter-Sentiment-Analyzer

A small uWSGI application built in python to search and analyze tweet sentiment based on the given input search key and tweet count.

We are using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) as the web framework and [tweepy](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/api.html) library to access the twitter api.

Checkout the app deployed on heroku [here](https://rishid-twitter-app.herokuapp.com/).
